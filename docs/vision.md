# Vision
**Problem:** Hard to see how the internet *feels* about entities (tickers/issues) in near real-time.  
**Audience:** Solo dev (me), traders/researchers later.  
**Outcome (MVP):** Reddit-only stocks & politics. 24h/7d windows, hourly ingest, top entities + time-series + example posts.

**Non-goals (MVP):** Auth, multi-tenant, heavy moderation, complex RBAC.
